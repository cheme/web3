TODO fuse with ownership!! or put description from index here and link ownership -> trust right should be only point about copyright!!!

Trustright, catchy play on word, but the real sense is closer to [ownership][./ownership.md] right. 

An alternative to copyright where the major point is not to forbid/stop information/data exchange, but to ensure that data/information is related to its lawful owner.

The idea is that it is a lost cause to try to protect information, and it is better to try to keep the information valid with all its associated information.

* personal information
 - information would not disappear easily from the web : the best way to make a public information disappear is to let it being forget by allowing new information to take over. 
 - you need the right to revoke or distrust directly information and the possibility to make it public easilly.

* copyright information

link to rightfull owner of an information is the thing that must not be lost.
 - today many artist (notably free web comics) rely on derivative product and donation. Yet they need their own diffusion plateform, to be sure that the benefit of the enthusiasm for their work will go to them.
 - copyright content, are shared wildly, and there is no direct benefit from this (except that good content is more likely to be bought), having a way for donation on copyright content seems right (even directly to authors or specifically to some actors).


The general idea is that you don't own info/data/concept but are trusted to be the owner.

* valuation

Everything that is owned has value. see [exchange markets][./exchange.md]. And the fact that a fork could be done does not diminished its value (otherwhise big social network would not be as hegemonic as they are), because the value is **a trust value** (a fork is successful only if its trust is better than the original (for example who trust oracle for opensource project : welcome libreoffice)).

Trust allow to remunerate content easily : when buying a content in a store where does money go? I wanted it to go for the scenarist, the rest of the movie was utter shit.
