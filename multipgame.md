  ragnarok analogy - return to official : because clean even if you need to pay -> [code] as ressource
  More value for more trusted, more shared challenging approach [items](./item.md) (even for player who does not really consider social interaction), more trust on the ownership of their achievments.

multiples actors :

- core game programmer : 

- content creator : map, item, p .most likely two be game company

- game exploitant : rules, item adjustment .... leverage of algo to detect cheater
  most of the time also provide some big server ressources (so their trust on server allow some more monetirization rules which should not be accepted other whise

- server provider : host of persistent world (map or world define in term of shared striple).
  For game like counter strike, it should be simply session host
  For game like wow, it should be shared between multiple dynamic session host, yet it involve complex striple synchronization to allow a coherent gaming experience, and big server still may be usefull.


balance between trust content - core retribution and exploitant - server
