code as statement and trust in applicative, value + fork + opensource


Making a programme, its [code] is value, there is true design decision to take over what should be infered, what should be striples, what cross application triples to address, what simplification to make, and this is really what will impact the [topology] of the knowledge, coding is in itself a form of ownership : 
   - so we need opensource for distributed application (otherwhise )
   - and from that version of an application is an striples leading to possible :
      - donation
      - version control and patch correction rewards...

TODO develop on the fact that code use and iteroperability
