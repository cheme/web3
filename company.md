Model of economy for company relying on info for living.

- trust reliability
- 24/24 server with big bandwith allowing their database to help convergence.


yet the possibility for user / applicative rules to distrust those, example :
- hardcoded in applicative (appilcation are central) : this is dangerous and user should only use [opensource](./code.md) to be able to fork application in case of abusive filtering (or privilege) of statement
- through smart applicative inference rules


Trusted company could intervenne in merging and convergence by defining synonym of existing triples that will allow to lower the number of far striple (orphan by low propagation).
For example, on a for of an striple, the company could issue its fork relation that applicative will check. The company service being an equivalence or inference helper (like a TODO moteur de recherche). This could also be achieve by [sidechain](./sidechain.md) insertion of hash, which is not incompatible with the company service : being in the side chain is a way to fact check yet it does not mean that it is fastly and conveniently accessible (especially if only a hash of a whole merkle tree is stored) and compatible with low ressource inference algorithm.
We see a model where the sidechain makes that everyone can fact check, yet data mining company still have added value.


In most use case being a major trusted peer really influencing network by establishing correct trust is a full time job.
