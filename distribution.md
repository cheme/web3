P2P is good for distribution.

When streaming video over bittorent protocol, this is high quality service, for video watch by thousands, quality should be as good (or better) as commercial platform. It helps hosting content (commercial video should by a small torrent server  less important contant should be seeded from home easily), it helps bandwidth, it is better for everything, except that a platform such as youtube let you earn money through advertising and viewing. The step to peer2peer web content is a rational one (platform such as youtube should think about p2p their videos, when watching a video the user also seed it (but websocket does not allow simply to exchange content between users and a browser plugin should be required, and privacy question arises but using such platform no privacy should be expected)), blizzard usage of torrent protocol is something really nice. The other step is to fully p2p the content, but how can advertising follows, we have seen some major windows torrent client going this way, but it only centralized to a company. Next generation should be company selling advertisement if the video owner link them to its video for advertisement diffusion and the company by its trust gets advertiser.
  Then follows the model of advertisement, for video it could be included in the video meaning that the resource is forked to a resource with advertisement and the incentive for getting resource with advertisement is simply that it got a massive server seeding behind it.  
  Less intrusive model, should be to have creator friendly video readers (on aggregator website or generic player allowing streaming like vlc) : you should be impressed to see that users think it is important to support creators (and the concept model allows easy and safe tipping).

# Usage of external service

Hybrid model, where some external url (plus obviously hash) equivalence should be include : for instance hosting on S3 of resource.
