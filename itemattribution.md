  - multi user random and share value


TODO rewrite this and explain more the statistical aspect of trust in random :

Process Overview
----------------

Items being is defined by wot signing.

Acquisition of an item is related to obtaining an item handle. This acquisition must be proofed (this is the difficult part). So we need a challenge to validate handle acquisition. (challenge could be a lot of thing eg a link to a captcha). Challenge process involve several step (we cannot publish the result immediatly).

Second point is choice of item per handle, which is distributed random process. The idea is to balance wot through normal statistical distribution, that way big cheaters will get out of trust, small cheaters ok. It ends with a distribution validation step.

Construction of random value is obviously by usage of seed of all random users.
