Public open knowledge database are today mostly wikis. The wiki case is very interesting by its diversity and the fact that successful wiki are sometime non profit wiki.

Usage of Striple over wiki information give obviously a better control over collaboration and more publicly information about the trust to give to a wiki (through authoring trust but also possible reviewer/reader additional trust).


# Structuration of info

Wiki editing tools should enforce semistructured description of info (not only textual), this is the case through link and page composition. Wiki should allow and enforce semantic description ([rdf](./rdfmapping.md)) and therefore Striple conversion.

For this see [dbpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) initiative.


# Information topology and interoperability

Wiki as knowledge database can cohexist, [topology](./topology.md) ensure that. 

wikipedia and desencyclopedia can therefore cohexist.

# Information management

wiki should be like git : fork, merge, version ... And Striple like that.

# Trust

Topology of wiki must be led by trust, if job done badly, wrong content added, distrust occurs to modify topology (multimorph wiki).

Info selection process is totally transparent.
