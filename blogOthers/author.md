Hello, this is [Ã‰meric](http://github.com/cheme) from its own little blog.

Yet another developper blog for posting about my everyday idea or views about informatics. 

I intend to also add the result of my own little investigation or various techno.

A big part of this site is generated from my documentation of striple (date of such post are quite false), which is simply a new concept of old thing aka nothing new but in practice everyone should do things like that and it is not the case. In short it is just applying web and web of trust concept to everything in a generic manner (the page about web semantic shows some obvious similarities but who do web semantic when google is here to manage your page mining).

Also I'm a french guy so most of the content might contain lot of 'frenglish', gramatical nonsense... Please feel free to send push over it (the site and striple content is on my github).

Also my post might contain some 'TODO' it is a bad habit of mine, if you are interested of the possible content of some TODO please ask because most of the time TODO stay TODO...


Hope you enjoy some of the content, or at least share your opinion.
