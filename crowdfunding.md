Here bitcoin smart property (multiple inputs requiring to reach a threshold output (threshold being a step for funding))  seems to be the more practical solution (unless you want to fund something with trust which is far to be practical, maybe in a few year who knows).

In a way bitcoin contract could be simplified by managing the temporary info as Striple (the promises (incomplete bitcoin transaction with an expiration date) and the required infos for the actual funding)).

Even in context of using bitcoin contract to manage funds, Striple keep great interest in the publicly available information (and also to be able to skip intermediary like kickstarter (kickstarter role will be informative by emitting trust Striple over some projects) :
- discovery of interesting project based on trust
- evolution of trusting in time (for example the actual promises balance, and some more trust related with Striples used as critics).
- all over possible Striple info to help a trust raising and a subsequent fundraising
