assets shared and valualized as striples

# monetarization

Real world value, notably for creator : 
- striple [ownership][./ownership.md]
- game being program (code and authored asset), compilation of build or server should keep striples dependency to have a view over striples (assets) usage (plus their ownership striples rules defining remuneration condition) and being able to distribute money fairly (either through a central collecting and redistribution or a more p2p approach). It is similar to [code][./code.md] and [linker][linker.md] approach.
