This is sample test code from another started project which use similar concept :
``` haskell


```
TODO get code from bitbucket and fill table

The striple should be :


striple id | from | about | content    
-----------------------------------
           |      |       |
           |      |       |
           |      |       |
           |      |       |
           |      |       |
           |      |       |
           |      |       |
           |      |       |


Note that sample is overdoing it a bit, for real application, it may be more realist to include multiple information in content : for example an RDF like application with trust from users : `from` become user id, `about` the second entity id and in content the first entity id and third entity id. 
When the right way to do it should involve a lot more striples.
