Rendering is dependent of the use case, of the applicative.

Yet being able to render striple generically is a nice to have to understand higher level organization of data.

Rendering of striple should be graph like without visualisation of abstract id (when multiple hop of ids relation an indice should describe it). Visualisation of abstract id or intermediary striple should be dependant of user action (hover, click...).

Convenient techno are svg (graph like representation plus web) and other more graph orinetied visualisation lib (graphviz...).

Advanced visualization should allow a kind of browsing of striple (following link requesting linked to, affining to some about striple...). An obvious exemple is any source control graph of revision (fork and version being advance rafinement).
